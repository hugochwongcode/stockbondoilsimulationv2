# Portfolio Simulator Version 2 with AI NLP Models
This repository contains code for a financial simulation utilizing three different Natural Language Processing (NLP) models: Community GPT2 XL, MetaLlama 2 13b-chat-hf and AdaptLLM finance-chat. These models are accessible through Hugging Face's model hub.

## Requirements
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
1. PyTorch
2. Transformers
3. Hugging Face Hub

You'll also need to register for a Hugging Face account and obtain an access token to use the models.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) model
1. GPT2 XL model https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2-xl
2. MetaLlama 2 13b-chat-hf https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf 
3. AdaptLLM finance-chat https://huggingface.co/AdaptLLM/finance-chat

## Usage
To use the financial simulation, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the code in an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
Run the desired script to initiate the financial simulation.

## Demo
To demonstrate the usage of the GPT2 XL model, a sample script 'financial_simulation_with_GPT2XL.ipynb' is provided. This notebook showcases how to interact with the GPT2 XL model for financial simulation purposes. However, note that the result may not be satisfactory due to the limitations of the model or the training data.

## Hardware Limitations
Please note that running the scripts for MetaLlama 2 13b and AdaptLLM Finance-Chat models may require substantial computational resources. If your laptop is not powerful enough to run these scripts, consider utilizing cloud-based solutions or running the code on a more robust system. Additionally, I am limited by my laptop's hardware capabilities and may not be able to personally run these resource-intensive scripts.
